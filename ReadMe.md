# Casette Calculator
I've found that I have a particular fondness for the occasional wow and flutter sounds that you can really only get out of an old audio-casette, but since I get all my music digitally, I have to dub them off my phone onto the actual casette. 
I need a way to keep track of how much of a side I'd used, so I'm making this. Additionally, I need to work on my javascript skills, so this is my project to improve that skill-set. 
To that end, yes, I'll be using react for the frontend, but don't expect wonders from the way things look, I intend to brush up on my back-end stuff.

## Intended Branch Structure
1. Master
	* The most recent "production ready" build of the site. Ideally, should only be updated via a well-reviewed pull request from develop. 
2. Develop
	* The most recent "beta" build of the site. Contains the amalgamated stable features of any feat/ branches, and should work properly, but is not yet confirmed to be 110% stable (and therefore ready for master). 
3. Feat/
	* Any remaining branches should begin with the tag feat/, and these are the "tinker spaces" where the programmers work on features without fear of dealing with stability.
